    "long_description": "Access to clean water is a fundamental human right, yet many African communities still lack this basic necessity. Our Clean Water Access Project works to change this reality by installing boreholes, hand pumps, and water filtration systems in remote villages. Each installation is accompanied by community training on water management, hygiene practices, and maintenance protocols to ensure long-term sustainability. Since the project's inception, we've provided clean water access to over 10,000 people across 15 communities. The impact extends beyond health improvements; children, especially girls, can now attend school regularly instead of spending hours fetching water, and women have more time for economic activities.",
